Chandu is a bad student. Once his teacher asked him to print the reverse of a given string. He took three hours to solve it. The teacher got agitated at Chandu and asked you the same question. Can you solve it?

Input:
The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains a string S, comprising of only lower case letters.

Output:
For each test case, print the reverse of the string S.

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 10
1 <= |S| <= 30


#include <stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
int main(){
	int num,len,i;
	char str[31];
	scanf("%d", &num);              			// Reading input from STDIN
	//printf("Input number is %d.\n", num);       // Writing output to STDOUT
    while(num--)
    {
        scanf("%s",str);
        len=strlen(str);
        for(i=len-1;i>=0;i--)
        {
            printf("%c",str[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    
}
